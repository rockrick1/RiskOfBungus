# Risk of Bungus (Working Title)

## Premise

Roguelike shooter with Diablo and Risk of Rain elements, fluid player movement and high volume of customization.

## Features
The main character is a robot that can change body parts, each part having specific mechanics.

At the end of each level the player gains a new random part, the higher the level, the greater the chance of winning rarer parts.

Robotic parts are permanent items that cannot be lost upon death.

Within each run there will be temporary items to assist the player in that run only, upon completing the run or dying, the player loses all temporary items.

The character's legs will dictate the type of movement. Run, Slide, Fly, etc.

The movement is inspired by games like Mario Odyssey, Titanfall and Doom Eternal.

## Original third person template from WaffleAWT

You have exported variables both on the player and the SpringArmPivot nodes
where you can control movement and FOV.

I'm willing to upload much more templates to kickstart projects on Godot.
This is my first asset, feel free to suggest assets to be made:
